Introducing "Cyeonna" ...
  You may be using small softwares called "widgets" on your computers that can, for instance, show you clocks, weather forecasts, stock prices, and so on.
  By using this software, you can also do the same on your PSP (Sony PlayStation Portable) unit! It is also useful to make a quick demo like something interactive working on the small screen.
The Widget engine is built based on the specs from Google Desktop Widgets and you can write widgets with Javascript. For quick start, downloading some widgets from their web site and run is good way. (but it may need some patches)
* This software is still far from it's goal, just only small part of features are implemented. This software is made with goodwill, but still has posibility to harm your units and to damage your data. This software is provided "as is", please understand that and use on your own risk.
  - All works about this software attributes to openeddistagon@gmail.com
    (except many parts that supports this software, see below)

Requirements
- PSP *homebrew software enabled* (I can't explain how you get this, please google it)
- A Memorystick (empty 512MB-1GB would be enough)

License
- GPLv2

Installation
- Agree the licence and download zip distribution archive from this site
- Extract the zip into your memstick under \GAME folder (folder name may be different by your PSP FW version)

- Once the app starts, example widgets would be appeared. Please enjoy!
